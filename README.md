#Huffman String Compression

###Introduction
A simple Huffman compressor which reads in a string into the command line and outputs the string as a Huffman encoded binary string rather than the ASCII encoded binary string, Also outputs the compression ratio achieved.

###Future Plans
I plan to improve the program to read in from a .txt file and output the encoded binary string to a binary file .bin and store the symbol tables used by the encoder in a decoder program.
